## Notes

I had some issues working in the design section as the buttons I would add would only stay in the top left corner no matter how I tried to move it, but I found out how to manually move it but I found where they mistake was.
I had to fix my relative layout to get it to work properly. I also had issues where I was by mistake with some of the other UI components.
